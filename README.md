Research interests
---

My research focuses on visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and integrated navigation for robots. I am particularly interested in fusion of image, IMU, GPS, and visual tags in order to make an accurate and robust indoor/outdoor positioning system. 

Positioning system is the eye for robots. I believe that a stable and precise positioning front-end is critical for robots to fulfil complicated tasks.
